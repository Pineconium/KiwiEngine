# The _KiwiEngine_

A new web engine meant as a replacement for Chromium. Planned to be made from scratch in C++ and to be the primary web browser in Choacury!

See TODO.MD for what needs to be done!

## Requirements
To compile Kiwi for yourself, you'll need:
- Any C++ compiler (GCC is the default by the build script)
- SDL2 installed
